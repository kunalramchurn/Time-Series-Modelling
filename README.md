# Time-Series-Modelling

The content of this analysis refer to the Univariate time series modelling that is only one variable will be explored, which is the Electricty consumption measured in Watts/Kilowatts between 1985 to 2014. 


### Steps covered in this notebook:

### EDA:
- Identifying trend patterns
- Applying Smoothing techniques using Moving-Average
- Seasonal decomposition procedures
- Testing for stationarity
- White Noise detection
- Autcorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation analysis
- Differencing technique - Making Time series stationary 

### Modelling:
- Time-Series Modelling using the ARIMA model
- Model Evaluation
