# Time-Series-Modelling

The purpose of this time series analysis is to shed light on the trend and seasonality of electricty consumption between the years 1985 to 2014,and the application of the ARIMA model to the dataset and its evaluation. Furthermore, the analysis will be Univariate that is only one variable will be explored, and the measurement scale is denoted in Watts/Kilowatts.

### Steps covered in this notebook:

### EDA:
- Identifying trend patterns
- Applying smoothing techniques using Moving-Average
- Seasonal decomposition procedures
- Testing for stationarity
- White noise detection
- Autcorrelation and partial autocorrelation analysis
- Differencing technique - Making time series stationary 

### Modelling:
- Time-Series Modelling using the ARIMA model
- Model Evaluation
